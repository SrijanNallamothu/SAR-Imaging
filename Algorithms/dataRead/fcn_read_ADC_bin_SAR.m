% AngleArr is phases for current Tx across Rx at the bin specified in radar_fft.m. Similarly ValueArr is the complex value.
% RangeArr is the actual bin number where the highest peak is after near DC
% FFT phase is the phase variation near specified bin in radar_fft.m. bin_axis is corresponding bins.
% RMS Noise gives noise power

% plot_switch is 1 for plotting the range fft and 0 for not plotting range fft
