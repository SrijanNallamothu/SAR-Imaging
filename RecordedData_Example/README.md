# MIMO-SAR-mmWave-Imaging-Toolbox

In this repository, we develop a comprehensive open-source MIMO-SAR imaging toolbox, which is a MATLAB based software package, including the complete signal processing chain of the prototyped testbed solutions in our journal paper (please see the reference below). The toolbox allows the user to control the testbeds and to reconstruct high-resolution 3-D holographic images using the captured experimental data.

The developed toolbox consists of three main modules: (1) data capture, (2) MIMO array calibration, and (3) image reconstruction. The framework of each module is detailed in our journal paper.
